# Textures
In this tutorial we learn the basics of creating material assets in Stride game studio. We create a diffuse material and a material that used both diffuse and a normal texture. Since there are so many options for materials we learn about the different properties in a general sense rather than displaying all the possibilities.

> [!NOTE]
> These videos were recorded when Stride was called 'Xenko'. Other than the name and logo change, the UI is almost 100% identical.
