# Game studio
The Stride engine comes with an editor called Game Studio. The videos below cover the basics of the UI and how various concepts work inside the editor. 

> [!NOTE]
> These videos were recorded when Stride was called 'Xenko'. Other than the name and logo change, the UI is almost 100% identical.
