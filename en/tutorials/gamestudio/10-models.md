# Models
In this tutorial we learn about models in Stride game studio. We learn about 5 different import scenarios. Some models have textures which we can automatically apply by importing the right material and textures files.

> [!NOTE]
> These videos were recorded when Stride was called 'Xenko'. Other than the name and logo change, the UI is almost 100% identical.
