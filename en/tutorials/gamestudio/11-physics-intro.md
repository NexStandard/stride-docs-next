# Physics intro
In this tutorial we learn about the basics of physics with Stride game studio. We learn that there are 3 different types of collider components and how to debug those in game studio as well as ingame.

> [!NOTE]
> These videos were recorded when Stride was called 'Xenko'. Other than the name and logo change, the UI is almost 100% identical.
