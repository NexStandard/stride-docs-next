# Importing resources
In this tutorial we learn how to import resources in to Stride game studio in 2 different ways: by creating an asset via the asset view or by dragging and dropping files directly from a folder. We also learn how important it is that we keep our resources in a projects resources folder, rather than having them scattered across our computer.

> [!NOTE]
> These videos were recorded when Stride was called 'Xenko'. Other than the name and logo change, the UI is almost 100% identical.
