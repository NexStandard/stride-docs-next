## üöÄ Getting Started

Welcome to the Stride documentation repository. This repository contains all the source files for the Stride documentation (http://doc.stride3d.net/). 

Anyone is welcome to contribute! Before you start, please take the time to read the [guidelines](GUIDELINES.md). 

You can find basic information about editing the documentation in [Getting Started](GETTINGSTARTED.md) dedicated page.

Happy editing!

### Manage multiple Stride versions

Each Stride minor version (i.e. 4.0, 4.1, etc.) should have its own branch, named in the fashion `master-<version>`. The only exception is latest version, which should be `master`.

Don't forget to change `$version` in [deploy.ps1](build/deploy.ps1) when branching before first deployment.

<!--All the information you need to get started with Stride Website development can be found in the üìö [Stride Docs Wiki](https://github.com/VaclavElias/stride-docs-next/wiki).-->

## ü§ù Contributing

Use [Discord](https://discord.gg/f6aerfE) for questions and general discussions. 
Use [Issues](https://github.com/stride3d/stride-docs/issues) to report bugs and proposing features.

We welcome code contributions through pull requests. Issues tagged as **[`help-wanted`](https://github.com/stride3d/stride-website/labels/help-wanted)** are good candidates for starting to contribute code.

### Branch and Release

The `master` branch is the default branch for pull requests and most other development activities. 

Releases are based on a stable `master` branch. Use of [Conventional Commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) is encouraged.

Stride Docs website is _not_ released under a regular cadence; new updates arrive when maintainers fix issues or see enough changes that warrant a new releases. Sometimes we use prereleases to get feedbacks from the community.
