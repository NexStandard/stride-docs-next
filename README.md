We welcome code contributions through pull requests. Issues tagged as **[`help-wanted`](https://github.com/stride3d/stride-website/labels/help-wanted)** are good candidates for starting to contribute code.

### Branch and Release

The `master` branch is the default branch for pull requests and most other development activities. 

Releases are based on a stable `master` branch. Use of [Conventional Commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) is encouraged.

Stride Docs website is _not_ released under a regular cadence; new updates arrive when maintainers fix issues or see enough changes that warrant a new releases.

### Staging

The staging website allows us to test new features and significant changes before their official release.

The staging website is available at https://stride-docs-staging.azurewebsites.net/

Don't forget to change `$version` in [deploy.ps1](build/deploy.ps1) when branching before first deployment.

### Manage multiple Stride versions

Each Stride minor version (i.e. 4.0, 4.1, etc.) should have its own branch, named in the fashion `master-<version>`. The only exception is latest version, which should be `master`.
